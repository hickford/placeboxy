Placeboxy
==========

A multiplayer web game similar to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle

This is my second project in the Ruby web framework Camping and with WebSockets library Pusher to provide real-time features. The game is deployed on Heroku at https://placeboxy.herokuapp.com/ 

To do
--------
 * Scoring (and winning)

Credits
--------
* Board generator and solver by [J. Eric Ivancich](http://learnruby.com/boggle/index.shtml), which I modified to use the faster library [fast_trie](https://github.com/tyler/trie) 
* Word list is the public domain [yawl](http://gtoal.com/wordgames/yawl/)
