# then solve multiple boards.

  # letter block will be a single letter (e.g., "a").  However, it can
  # handle letter blocks that can contain sequences (e.g., "qu").  It
  # knows who is neighboring letters are.  It also knows whether it's
  # been used (consumed) yet or not.  Can return a list of all
  # neighboring letters that are not yet used.
